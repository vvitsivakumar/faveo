### **Updates**

**SAML 2 Integration**
Faveo supports Single Sign-On(SSO) to transfer authentication data. SAML exchanges user information such as logins, authentication states, identifiers, and other relevant attributes between the identity provider and service provider. As a result, the authentication process is simplified and secure because the user only needs to log in once with a single set of authentication credentials.

- SSO can be configured in Admin Panel > Options

|====================================================
|   v6.0.0
|====================================================

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Faveo 6.0.0 onwards we have deprecated the support for PHP 7.3 and PHP 7.4, PHP 8.1+ is now the supported PHP version.
### **Updates**
- **Laravel and Php upgrade**

> PHP 8 is a major update of the PHP language.
> It contains many new features and optimizations including named arguments, union types, attributes, constructor property promotion, match expression, nullsafe operator, JIT, and improvements in the type system, error handling, and consistency.
>

_**New Features in Laravel 9**_

- Minimum PHP Requirement

> First and most importantly, Laravel 9 requires the PHP 8 and PHPUnit 8 for testing. That’s because Laravel 9 will be using the newest Symfony v6.0, which also requires PHP 8.
>
> PHP 8 has significant improvements, and features, from the JIT compile to constructor property promotion.

- Anonymous Stub Migration
> Laravel sets to make anonymous stub migration the default behavior when one runs the popular migration command:
_php artisan make:migration_
The anonymous stub migration feature was first released in Laravel 8.37 to solve [this Github issue](https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/5899). The issue is that multiple migrations with the same class name can cause problems when trying to recreate the database from scratch. The new stub migration feature eliminates migration class name collisions.
>
> From Laravel 8.37, the framework now supports anonymous class migration files, and in Laravel 9, it will be the default behavior.

- New Query Builder Interface
> With the new Laravel 9, type hinting is highly reliable for refactoring, static analysis, and code completion in their IDEs. Due to the lack of shared interface or inheritance between Query\Builder, Eloquent\Builder, and Eloquent\Relation. Still, with Laravel 9, developers can now enjoy the new query builder interface for type hinting, refactoring, and static analysis.

- PHP 8 String Functions
> Since Laravel 9 targets PHP 8.  These functions include the use of str_contains(), str_starts_with(), and str_ends_with() internally in the \Illuminate\Support\Str class.
>
> Laravel 9’s features and improvements listed above are a sneak peek at what is to come. It’ll most definitely bring lots of bug fixes, features, and, of course, many breaking changes.

|====================================================
|   v4.10.5
|====================================================
### **Updates**

**- MyISAM to InnoDB Conversion**

 It helps to improve performance in the system and database levels, during database transactions, or to fetch data from a database that provides an efficient way.


### **Bug Fixes**

- Remove edit option for change after cab approval


|====================================================
|   v4.10.4
|====================================================
### **Updates**

**- Update Manager**

 Until v4.10.3, whenever an update has happened, it's not efficient for a quick process. Now we enhanced this feature to process fast as possible with an OAuth-based authentication.

**- Workflow and Listener in change**

We implemented workflow and listener in the change module which will come under Servicedesk Plugin. In the change workflow request, we can enforce an action that was related to the change like Task template, Ticket template, Applying for CAB, and Status. So These actions will be enforced in the change module whenever an event is triggered.
![Workflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88606418/186077178-3a5d777a-1189-4bf4-8bd3-a5211a61452f.gif)

In the change listener, according to action, the events will be enforced on the change like CAB and Status. But we can choose either one CAB or status because both are related to the status of the change.
![Listener](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88606418/186078189-fc722e22-f25e-46ec-9d5d-566b91cda725.gif)

**- Old Imap Refinement**

In Imap, it will support the local native language during the email fetching process. We included some criteria for better handling the tickets whereas restricted an attachment or add-media size up to a maximum of 20 MB and ignored corrupted path attachments from emails.

**- User Export**

In User export, we supported some user columns and all custom columns. We can filter the column and apply it to the data tables which will display in the user table before export.
![User Export](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88606418/186084701-a3f750b2-2f7c-42c6-a1a0-fb4698255a3a.gif)

**- All Tickets Permission**

We introduced a new kind of permission which is all tickets. If an agent has All ticket permission, he can view all tickets from other departments without any irrespective of permission.
![AllTicket](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88606418/186080808-1af2708e-c232-4031-b723-3a419f9d3f6e.gif)

|====================================================
This release provide updates in the Facebook bot, Task plugin, S3 private bucket integration, some other features with dependencies and bug fixes too.

### Updates

**- Facebook bot**

The system supports creation of ticket, raising complaint, conversation with agent from facebook messenger. With the help of Sirpi, facebook bot integrated with faveo. Now, an end user can choose an option from chat bot to move forward with issues or complaint in the system. The bot will ask email, address and pin code. If email-id does not exist, it will create a new user. If exists, the complaint will be raised under the end-user.
![FacebookBot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88606418/167780232-d1850a8a-443c-4805-b938-ae22b768c774.gif)
If the ticket has been created, an end user can start conversation with system agent. Once an issue resolved and ticket closed, the conversation between agent and an end-user will be ended. Then, The bot will take over the chat.
![TicketClosedFacebbokBot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88606418/167789699-a354bc04-d061-4c61-9000-45acf5749f57.gif)

**- Task Plugin**

The system comes with a efficient features and better user-interface in task plugin. In task, we implemented calendar view for better Ui experience. Now, The task can be linked with change module. It able to add existing task from ticket or change. Each task has comment section which can make a conversation with creator or assigned agent.
![Task-Changes-comments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88606418/167846207-124a6118-cef8-4485-bd85-946a4328ffc8.gif)

An agent or admin can create a private task from the dashboard. As we can filter the task by due date or created date of an individual task.
![Task-filter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88606418/167815218-3ea6ac90-d727-43ca-b72c-e84b8f961615.gif)


**- S3 Private Bucket**

Currently, we added a S3 private bucket in the file storage for avoiding security breaches. It's provides high-valued architecture security for file attachments and storage needs. During Faveo installation, select 's3' as storage disk, Or do add AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_DEFAULT_REGION, AWS_BUCKET, AWS_ENDPOINT in the '.env' file and make 's3' in the disk columns setting_system table. Then back to the .env file , do add or change CACHE_DRIVER = array.

For technical changelog see https://github.com/ladybirdweb/faveo-helpdesk-advance/blob/development/ChangeLogs.md#4102

|====================================================
|   v4.10.1
|====================================================
This release provides the update in the Rating module and newly improved Daily reporting functionality which will be helpful to overview the ticket activities at a glance. With these feature updates, this release also provides various improvements and bug fixes along with security updates for dependencies.

### Updates
- #### Improved Daily Report
  The system now has an improved daily reporting which can be customized by the Admins. Admin can add or remove required widgets from the report. The agents will receive the report at the time set by the admin on the cron settings page. These widgets can be customized to send the minimal required data as a report before work hours to the agents so that they can see the information which is important to them and plan their day. The system now also allows sending system analysis to the admins so that they can overview the activities from the report.
  ![daily_report_settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/162682855-afbeeaf2-c4e5-4acd-8e21-df73ef6dafa5.gif)
  The saved report will be mailed to agents with the content accessible and visible to them so they can have an overview of the system daily.
  ![report_in_mail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/162683140-6631a6bd-870b-4891-b57d-6c3575301eb7.gif)

- #### Rating module update
  The rating module has been refined to record the overall experience of the users while interacting with the agents on their tickets. This is to avoid confusion for clients by asking them ratings on each thread reply of the agents resulting in focusing on ranking the agent's performance based on overall interaction with the client and overall feedback provided by the agents.
  Additionally, we can now include additional feedback comments or questions to be submitted by the clients on the rating settings page.
  ![Screenshot 2022-04-11 at 1 31 05 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/162692912-73d33eea-2f32-4234-b20a-5e45406e42b5.png)
  These additional comments and questions can be answered by clients when submitting ratings via the link received in the mail. 
  ![rating_submission](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/162692823-1b5fb435-72c1-4a79-8c5b-3ee61ff337b6.gif)

  We have also added **Feedback Rating Analysis** which helps to understand customers satisfaction ratio and feedback at a glance.
  ![rating-report](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/162694137-0f121612-7b3a-4e7e-a9ec-1a57f9259151.png)

- #### Multiple organization and organization departments linking with users
  The system now allows adding a user to multiple organization departments which was not allowed previously. This has been done to handle the case where you provide services to the organization with multiple departments where a single user plays an important role in two or more departments.

- #### Go to home
  When the agents and admins log into the system there was not an easy way to navigate to the client panel for them. Added a new navigation link in the sidebar so that they can simply navigate to the client panel home page.

- #### Approval pending client filter for tickets
  Now admin can add filters in the client filters to show them the tickets which are pending their approval so that they can directly take an action on such tickets. The new tab will show the tickets on which approval of the logged-in user is required or pending.
  ![Screenshot 2022-04-11 at 3 10 55 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/162711666-07e9b64c-1df6-469b-b903-5dc2fc604d23.png)

- #### 2FA updates
  To make your use login secure, we have now added an option for the admin to force enable the 2FA set up for every user. Using this setting every user will have to configure their 2FA set up to be able to login to the system. If the admin enables this setting then logged or non-logged-in users who have not configured the 2FA for their account will be prompted to set up the 2FA before they can access the system.
  ![2fa-force](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/162714044-7de88150-3b54-4449-89d4-29a7bda4b6c5.gif)
  
  Additionally system now allows users to download 10 unique recovery codes which they can use a single time to login into the system in case they do not have access to their 2FA setup device. Each code is for single use only so once the code is used for login it can not be reused. These codes can be downloaded on the 2FA setup screen or can be regenerated from the profile page as and when required.

- Updated composer dependencies
- Updated Vue framework version to 2.6.14 along with other npm dependencies
- Updated the following JavaScript libraries
  - jQuery to v3.5.1
  - Moment.js to v2.29.1
  - AngularJS to v1.8.2 
 - Cleaned and removed old vulnerable JS resources and unused Laravel blades

Since [v4.8.1](https://github.com/ladybirdweb/faveo-helpdesk-advance/tree/v4.8.1) the system has been forced to use an SSL URL scheme to work over HTTPS. Below are additional updates which have been forced to make the system secure from vulnerabilities.
- **For security:** The system now sets `secure` and `httponly` attributes on the cookies in the response header to secure cookies
- **For security:** [HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HSTS) has been enabled in the response header. Now the system will be forced to be accessed using "HTTPS". This will make the system more secure and will require a valid SSL for the system domain. 
> NOTE: If your system has not been updated to v4.8.1 or is still not using HTTPS then we recommend installing an SSL on your system domain and restricting system access over HTTP before updating to this version.

|====================================================
|   v4.10.0
|====================================================
Faveo Helpdesk v4.10.0 adds a few feature updates in the system along with various bug fixes.

### Updates
- #### Knowledge base subcategories
  While maintaining a useful knowledge base for customers it's important to link or group the articles in proper categories so that the readers can easily navigate through the Knowledge base categories and articles to find the information they are looking for. Many times it's appropriate to link the categories to subcategories so that authors can maintain the proper hierarchy for the articles while keeping the articles inappropriate categories. Subcategories help to group or link the articles to link to their specifications as well as a general category so users can easily navigate and consume all required information from the knowledge base.
Faveo now allows you to link categories with parent categories or define subcategories for one category so you can categorize the articles in a better way. You can link the parent category to new or existing categories. 
![Screenshot 2022-03-01 at 12 14 35 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/156118694-6e3b9811-d42b-46b9-b4e6-0477702a9c33.png)
In the knowledge base, the subcategories will be listed along with the available articles in the category

- #### Collaborator filters in client panel tickets page
  Now clients can filter the tickets in their inbox by a collaborator of the tickets. Filtering by collaborator will fetch all the tickets accessible by the client (logged-in user) on which the selected users in the collaborator filter have been added as CC.
  ![Addcc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/156138596-f728060f-b395-4786-a186-c6b87dad730d.gif)
- #### My Team tickets
  Recently after updating teams, there was an issue where tickets assigned to the teams to which agent belongs were appearing under the "My tickets" section of the agent panel which was creating confusion. We have added a dedicated section to see those tickets that are assigned to the teams to keep my tickets section clean.
  ![Screenshot 2022-03-01 at 2 33 39 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/156138496-bfc46e7b-7484-423a-8308-e0b31bbd328f.png)

|====================================================
|   v4.9.1
|====================================================
This release provides refinements in workflow/listeners and SLA modules. Along with refinements, this update also fixes various pesky bugs in the system.

### Updates
- #### Timetrack module update
  While tracking time using Timetrack it is important to know which agent logged or updated the tracked time. Now while agents will log the time on the tickets the system will save their details and show them as the author for the tracked time.
  ![timetracking](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/154230031-4d8f5ac1-06b4-4479-a3fa-357b9120f109.gif)
- #### CORS support
  Now system APIs can be called from another domain or app in browsers. You can add a new variable `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN` in the *.env* file containing a comma-separated list of the domains for which you want to allow cross-origin access so that applications running on that domain can use data from your Faveo application. 
- #### Disabled Rules and actions in Workflow/Listener
  Workflow listeners have different rules and actions which you can select. But there are a few additional rules and actions which are only available on workflow/listeners when certain plugins are enabled. In short different plugins can also add new fields to rules and actions in the workflow. For example, the Calendar plugin adds a task field in actions when enabled. However, if you create a workflow/listeners with such rules and actions and those plugins get disabled it was hard to make any sense of them and hard to understand how and why to workflow got or did not get enforced.
Such fields in rules and actions will not be considered disabled fields. So those fields will show up as references in the workflow/listener but will not contribute to the processing of the workflow and listeners.
![disabled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/154246014-e8627dc4-363d-419f-9e6c-5c13fc50c938.gif)
NOTE:
  - Disabled rules will not be checked for conditions to enforce the workflow. Similarly, disabled actions will not be enforced by workflow and listeners.
  - You can not update disabled fields but you can remove them from workflow/listener.
  - Once you enable the plugin which adds the fields which are disabled those fields will be rendered back with the original value and will work as normal.

### Bug fixes
- Team is not removed from the ticket when the department of the tickets is changed.
- Merging and forking tickets updates the created at the time of threads to the time when tickets are merged/forked instead of keeping the original timings intact.
- TinyMCE content renders differently in the inbox.
- When we have a team and agents then workflow enforcement does not work properly.
- Agent panel SPA redirection issue.
- Changing language does not work in firefox.
- Client panel ticket filters issue.
- User profile added email copy option.
- System does not fetch HTML mails if the mail body is complex and long eg: mail has many tables, etc.
- Issue in mail fetching and recur ticket creation if the ticket is assigned to a team on creation or via workflow.
- SLA calculation and reporting refinements.
- Websocket connection not established in agent panel.
- Department manager SLA escalation not working.
- Recur ticket edit sets execution time and end date without even providing the values.
- Removed ad-hoc approval from listener actions.
- Miscellaneous UI and minor issues fixed.

### Changelogs
- Added unique IDs to HTML elements in the client panel for an internal purpose.
- Updated various npm packages with a security patch.
- Updated and locked axios to 0.20.1 which is the last compatible patched version for SSRF vulnerability.
- While updating users organization departments are getting removed.
- Deactivated agents show as "Deleted" in the activity logs in the system.
- Bumped Laravel framework version to v6.20.44.
- Removed composer.json available in the public directory because it was creating confusion.

For technical changelog see https://github.com/ladybirdweb/faveo-helpdesk-advance/blob/master/ChangeLogs.md#v491

|====================================================
|   v4.9.0
|====================================================
Helpdesk release v4.9.0 provides various refinements and bug fixes in the system. Below are listed some important updates in the system.

### Updates
- #### System Update script for Large database
  Updating from an older version to the new version when the system is being used extensively which contains huge data in the database and filesystem was a hectic task. Because the system has to handle all files and data optimally without breaking the update. We have improved how the file system is handled during the update and v4.9.0 provides a better experience for updating the system. Now file system updates will be processed in the background for which different Cron jobs have been added.
  <img width="1146" alt="cron" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/148341099-8a67778c-1ed4-49d1-a2a2-e40effb1cabb.png">
  We can also see the logs for jobs being processed
  <img width="1146" alt="log" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/148341251-3cb7d243-e760-4cc1-b9ba-2edc3b717a52.png">
  Once the jobs are processed and the files are updated in new structure the cron jobs will get disabled automatically.
- #### Adhoc approval added searchabilty
  Added ability for auto-fill, to search the system for registered users/agents and allow selection In the agent panel, where Adhoc approval email address is entered.
  <img width="1124" alt="adhoc" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/148361963-171875d8-4676-4ef1-9a0c-880fbd08cf00.png">
- #### Team module vue conversion and refinements
  Continuing conversion of modules into Vue v4.9.0 converts team module into Vue. Along with Vue conversion, we have also revamped the functionality of the Team module to make it more useful and meaningful. In many organizations, the query raised in a department first gets assigned to a team in that department then an actual agent who is responsible for solving the query is assigned. This helps in categorizing the queries in the further category in the department. *Faveo now allows assigning a ticket to a team and an agent both simultaneously.* So if the ticket is raised for a department it can be first assigned to a team linked with that department and further it can be assigned to an agent who belongs to the department and the team.
  Now you can create/edit teams and link them with multiple departments.
  ![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 11 09 23 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/148887411-0afd00be-a41a-460d-8510-bfe3aea41e60.png)

  The tickets in a department can be assigned to a linked team and an agent who is a member of both team and department.
  ![Screenshot 2022-01-06 at 1 11 16 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/148887254-85931b62-65db-4a10-be0d-d9464a3c2d15.png)

- #### Article visibility for organization members
  Now you can create/update articles and set their visibility for members of specific organizations. Article visibility for organization members is useful when you provide different services to different organizations and want to organization members articles related to the service they utilize. This also helps keep KB clean for a wider audience and hide the documents and articles which contain monetized information from general users. On the article page now you can select the visibility as "Organization member" and then select the organizations.
  <img width="584" alt="viso" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/148369163-48b63645-61ad-415b-83ec-1c233740368a.png">
  Similarly, we have made it easier for your content writing team to filter such articles from the article list by adding an option to filter the articles by organizations.
  <img width="1162" alt="orgl" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/148369428-f13d1d6f-3294-4a05-9f54-46c8cd0af52f.png">
- #### Fetch mail via new IMAP package
  Added an option to use the new IMAP package for fetching the mails. The mail fetching works the same as before with handling some additional [edge cases](#eml) for mail fetch which the old package was not handling.
  ![Screenshot 2022-01-06 at 1 20 33 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/148367021-947f9731-aeec-454c-9658-6e8b2897717d.png)
- #### Updates in task module
  We have updated the tasks module to enhance and improve its functionality. Below are the updates in the module
   - Allow tasks to belong to departments, just like tickets
  - Allow tasks to be assigned to a team or an individual.
    ![Screenshot 2022-01-06 at 4 16 48 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/148371326-27ad33d6-7f54-414b-9157-b5c23c0e140c.png)
  - Notification:
    - Notification should go to department members. Ability to turn notifications on/off for department members
    - Notifications can go to individuals and teams assigned to the task
    ![Screenshot 2022-01-06 at 4 19 29 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/148371624-6869c97e-3d08-4611-83fa-5e0142da572c.png)
  - Task View into the Dashboard:
    Tasks now are linked to the todo view in the dashboard and will appear in the dashboard too. 
  ![Screenshot 2022-01-06 at 4 22 25 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/148371894-e50cd0fa-42e2-48e5-be22-3f7e312e0f0b.png)
- #### SSL Support for DB connection
  If your MySQL server allows secure connection over SSL then you can not connect the Faveo application with the SSL user connection to secure your database connection. For new installation now you will be offered an option to provide an SSL key, certificate, and bundle files in .pem format. You must upload these files on the host server and provide the complete path to use these files while connecting to the database securely.
  ![Screenshot 2022-01-06 at 4 29 59 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/148372878-c6ff89e6-4087-4e2c-8ef8-0689bc4d96eb.png)
- #### Version control of the Articles in KB
  Articles in KB now have version history which helps you track the updates and changes in the articles made by different agents in the system. while editing the article you can see the version history section which will have the list of versions as below.
  ![Screenshot 2022-01-06 at 4 41 25 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/148374213-8b868d0b-fcbc-4d69-9088-b725fc9df74c.png)
  You can click on the version and see what updates have been made in the article since that version.

|====================================================
|   v4.8.1
|====================================================
Forcing SSL in URL Scheme

v4.8.1 updates the system to force HTTPS scheme and restricts system to only work on server which has valid SSL installed and can only be opened secruly over HTTPS.

> Note: As this update restricts the server from opening over http so we recommend to install SSL on the server before updating to this version.

|====================================================
|   v4.8.0
|====================================================
v4.8.0 is bundled with various updates and enhancements that make the system more intuitive for users of all roles and improve the overall experience of the user. Along with these updates, this release also patches various bugs in the system.

### Updates
- #### Vue conversion
  Continuing our efforts for converting the application to SPA we are constantly changing the remaining modules in the admin panel to Vue. This update converts the following modules to Vue.
  - Status module
  - LimeSurvey plugin
- #### Break-lines
  We always want to make the application better so it can help the agents to increase their productivity while working on the tickets from your customers. But for the threads and cases on which the conversation flows to and forth multiple times, it is easy to lose the track of important points hence it becomes harder to understand the what client is expecting and provide timely support.
  The application was not handling such conversation in a way that the agents can easily navigate to the important parts of the conversation for example the first thread in which the client reported their issue. The timeline looks messy and agents have to put extra effort to navigate to different sections in the timeline. The image below shows how messy the conversation can look.
  
  ![Without-trip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/142176400-e35b9695-5406-41ac-92ef-0143b056f520.gif)

  To be honest we have found it hard ourselves and decided to improve the system. So in v4.8.0, we are introducing **Breaklines** which allows you to add breakpoints for trimming such long conversations so the system trims the conversation and shows only the part of the conversations which your agents need to see. To see the complete conversation just click on the three dots and the system will load the complete thread. The image below shows the same conversation trimmed with Breaklines.
  
  ![with-trim](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/142176446-2d872095-c40a-4c3e-911c-4594cd79f70e.gif)

  The system has some preseeded Breaklines that you can update or add new Breakline from the admin panel under the email section.
![Screenshot 2021-11-17 at 12 13 48 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/142148488-4956ed08-09eb-4690-83b6-40721ee1fea3.png) ![Screenshot 2021-11-17 at 12 16 01 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/142148539-7585f521-0733-4935-9bd8-4ab310597628.png)
  In Breaklines you can use simple text string or if you are a geek like us you can also use [Regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to specify the text where the thread should be trimmed.
  
- #### Parent-child linking on tickets while forking
  The system now allows linking of tickets as parent and child tickets while forking the tickets. Now when we fork a ticket from the existing ticket we can update the description for the new ticket and the newly created ticket will be associated with the ticket as its child.
![foking](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/142151026-a65ee44e-7eda-4dcc-b03a-c9b3278eace5.gif)

- #### Worktime type in time track module
  Added a new field called **Worktime type** which can be linked with the time tracked on the ticket and or reply. Visibility and validation for the field can be handled from time track settings. You can add a list of worktime types that will be used as options in the fields in time tracking. Additionally, now you can track time while adding internal notes too.
 ![Screenshot 2021-11-17 at 12 45 56 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/142153035-f31f3536-c9fe-4eaa-93a3-21b47479d27a.png)
![Screenshot 2021-11-17 at 12 47 35 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/142154112-41206d29-c16b-4dd6-94bf-0ab40909954e.png)

  If you set visibility as yes then this field will appear in time tracking once you enter work time. In Time tracking popup
  ![yoYx8Llm24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/142154926-da1b5d63-dc82-4e7c-82a8-13b864ef605e.gif)

  In reply/note level time tracking.

- #### Client panel filters to show up to 5 tabs for filtered tickets in the client panel
  While implementing filters in the client panel ticket inbox, we had removed the different status tabs. These tabs categorize the ticket based on status and show filtered results in the table. So after removing those tabs, we have been getting many complaints that the clients or end users can not view the tickets without making 2-4 extra clicks.
  So we are getting back the filtered tabs in the client panel with some more options. Admin can now set up to 5 tabs(category) with different filters for the tickets. Clients will be able to see the tabs created by admins and the filtered tickets will be rendered in the table for that tab. For starters, we have seeded 2 filters by ourselves to show tickets of open and closed categories.
  The client filter settings can be found in the admin panel under the settings section.
  ![Screenshot 2021-11-17 at 1 16 38 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/142157673-6e55f1f0-339b-4f22-a68e-93a3fdf6d2b5.png)

  The clients will see these filters on my tickets page. They can also apply their filters to the tickets.

- #### Localised License support
  Faveo now supports the installation with the license file which can be downloaded and stored on the server. Faveo will use this file to check the valid installation.
  > NOTE: This is an on-demand feature as the license file installation for the product must be enabled by the Faveo team. 

- Faveo integration with Faveo's new License manager application
  Since we have updated our license manager application and we will deprecate the old application soon, this update contains the required changes within Faveo to use the new license manager for installation and validation of the license.
  
- Updated Adldap Library
  Updated Adldap package to the latest version to fix issues in the LDAP happening due to the old package.

- Embed YouTube videos in Knowledge base articles
  A good knowledge base contains media-rich articles which help the users by giving them information using different media like images, videos, etc. In the older version, we were not able to add YouTube videos in the articles but from v4.8.0 you can simply embed the YouTube video in the articles so that users do not have to open YouTube and migrate to the new window.

- S3 connection check-in installer if S3 is chosen as storage system
  Now when you will select S3 for storage during the installation you will have to pass valid credentials for S3 as the system will try to connect to the S3 bucket before installation.

- Alerts to users for failed login attempts
  Now when users will try to log in and enter the wrong credentials the system will send the notification alert for the failed login attempt to the users.

- Added shortcodes for creator details in notifications templates
  In notification templates, we have added new shortcodes to accommodate the details of the ticket creator. Useful in the case when agents are creating the ticket on behalf of clients. Now in ticket-related templates, you can find these new shortcodes.
  - {!! $creator_sign !!}
  - {!! $creator_contact !!}
  - {!! $creator_email !!}
  - {!! $creator_name !!}

- Send inline images as CID embedded images in mails
  Now in email settings, you can decide how the email will send the inline image content in the outgoing mails. CID embedded images can be enabled on each email so when the system is sending the mail which contains inline-image content it will convert that inline image as CID and embed data in the mail.

- Plugin name updates
  Changed plugin names to keep them human-readable and follow English semantics

- Additional configurations
  The Admin panel now has a new section that shows all the active plugins with additional setting options in the application so you can navigate and update those setting directly from the admin panel instead of opening the admin page.
  ![addtionals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/142177729-6c0b99eb-dd56-4889-a114-138cb8a3ab02.gif)

- Database custom port support 
  The system had various issues when installing or using it with the database servers which have a custom port. v4.8.0 fixes all those issues and makes the system compatible to use with such database servers.

- Check for SSL certificate added **[IMPORTANT UPDATE]**
  As we care about the security of the application, we take different steps to make our application secure. Since most of the internet is using SSL to secure the data transfer over HTTP we are making the changes in the next update that will refrain the application to work on non-SSL servers. In this version, we have put checks in probe and auto-update for SSL to check if the application can be opened using *HTTPS* with a valid SSL certificate or not.

- Put max and minimum database version checks for MySQL and MariaDB
  Added checks in probe and auto-update for the maximum and minimum version of MySQL/MariaDB servers required by the application.

|====================================================
|   v4.7.3
|====================================================
FB, WhatsApp and Telephony Fix

This release focuses on fixing the issue with Facebook, Whatsapp, and Telephony which failed the creation of tickets from these sources.

### Bug fixes
- Webhook CSRF token issue
- Ticket conversion from FB, WhatsApp, and Telephony channels

|====================================================
|   v4.7.2
|====================================================
Blocker Bug fixes

Fixes functional bugs introduced in v4.7.0

- Fixed unable to create tickets when ticket form has attachments fields.
- Fixed unable to edit or fork tickets when ticket form has attachments fields.
- Fixed ticket collaborators do not receive email notifications for replies made on the tickets
- Fixed in client panel Knowledge base search popup is not visible completely

|====================================================
|   v4.7.1
|====================================================
Hotfix seeder bug fixes

Fixed v4.7.0 seeder to handle update of old system's database in optimized manner with handling the exceptional cases.

- Fixed database update error: In some old systems database may have curropted data in users tables like having 2 or more users with same usernames. In these case location seeder is failing because it tries to update the user with duplicate username and gets an error. This results in termination of database syncing hence broken database update. Handled the exception to continue the database update process if such error arises.
- Optimized seeders: Some seeders shamelessly trying to update the tickets tables by looping over all the tickets in the database. Since older database may have lakh records and 2-3 seeders are looping over tickets this makes the process of database update inefficient and slow. Optimized such seeders to handle such huge databse with basic efficiency.
- Avoid triggering mail notifications: Some seeders are updating ticket model and triggering the notifications in the process of so called "junk cleaning". Tried to reduce such notifications to avoid loading mail job unnecessarily.

|====================================================
|   v4.7.0
|====================================================
After successfully converting the Client and Agent panel of Faveo to Vue SPA, the team is targeting Admin Vue conversion so the whole application can be converted to a SPA and improve the speed of the application. v4.7.0 focuses on converting different modules of the Admin panel to Vue along with various feature enhancements and bug fixes.

### Updates
- #### Admin Panel Vue Conversion
  We have converted the setting page of various modules to Vue along with the Admin panel mail page. Converting most settings page and index page of the admin panel to Vue gave us the confidence to be able to convert pending modules to Vue soon and convert the Admin panel to SPA to provide a seamless experience to admins while onboarding and system configuration. Here's the list of modules converted to Vue in this update
  - Priority Settings
  - Location Settings
  - HelpTopic Settings
  - Ticket Type settings
  - Billing settings
  - Admin Panel main settings page
  - Security settings
  - Template settings
> NOTE: Refer v4.6.0 release changelog section to see the deletion process update for the above resources

- Email notification template style updated
   We are revamping our notification module and made slight changes in the notification settings to accommodate the changes for allowing multiple channels for notifications, each having its own template set. This template set will be used to send notifications on these channels. Since notifications are one of the important modules we are trying to provide the updates ensuring old users do not have to break their heads and reconfigure the settings for notification from scratch. In this initial update, we have made changes to the template styles to make the templates look more clean and decent for any business. And same as before you are free to create your own template set in your preferred language and change the style including the content of the templates.

##### New email template preview in Gmail
![Screenshot 2021-09-24 at 6 11 00 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/134675737-56659b5e-2006-4340-badd-a1f94f74fdeb.png)

The templates are designed by keeping different mail client rendering. Now the links are clickable in mail clients like thunderbird and outlook too. Also to make it easier for users to modify the templates and use relevant shortcodes in the templates now on the template edit page you only see the shortcodes which are relevant for the template.
![developers productdemourl com_manish_public_template_edit_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/134676905-d28eb720-1c9b-4277-9fd8-6d2bab62c5d4.png)


> Note: if you are an existing user and have made changes to the templates or created your own template sets then do not worry they will be kept intact. Faveo branding has been added in the email templates which can not be removed by editing the templates. You can still remove Faveo branding by using the Whitelabel plugin.

- #### Added new language packages
  Added 3 new language translation packages in the system. These packages have been shared by our users and may not translate the system completely. Newly added packages are as below
  - Korean
  - Maltese
  - Vietnamese
- #### Support for using remote Redis server as cache
  The system now gives an option to select cache driver during installation. It also supports connection to the remote Redis server with authentication.

### Bugfixes
- Displaying User form custom field data only for client users
- Organization profile page was not showing the alert for errors
- Ticket fetch issue when message Id is missing
   In rare cases on some mail servers sometimes mail object does not contain a message ID. When Faveo fetched such mails it was not able to identify the thread to append such mails or reply. As a result replies on other tickets were getting appended on random tickets creating privacy issues as one customer was receiving details of another customer's ticket. We have handled the case by generating random message ID at Faveo for mails that do not have message ID when fetched via IMAP/POP.
- Increased Form field tooltip's size to allow long description for form fields to be shown in the tooltip.
- Emoji not rendering correctly in exported PDF of tickets
- Error in login for v3 APIs
- Breadcrumbs for chat plugin
- Login alerts were going out for the CLI process.
- Changes UI of maintenance mode screen
- In inbox Ticket List redirecting to page 1 when performing any action in next page tickets
- Issue in showing dates for KB articles
- In inbox CTRL+mouse click does not open tickets into a new tab
- Agent SPA redirection issue
- Removed Organisation document permission as it's not supported anymore
- Users were not importing from Azure AD
- Miscellaneous UI  and minor bugs

### Changelog
- Ticket Create/Edit API validation updated
   Now the params for resources like department, source, etc on ticket create/edit API will respect the presence of resource. If the given resource ID is not present then the API will throw a validation error. Eg: If we pass department id as 6 and there is no department in the database with id 6 then a validation error will be thrown.
- Laravel framework version bumped to v6.20.30
- V3 API support added for various Plugins
- Username validation updated to accommodate usernames from AD which may have different special characters.
- The color combination of the layout has been changed to use the default Admin LTE theme color scheme.

|====================================================
|   v4.6.2
|====================================================
High Security Risk Patched

v4.6.2 is a patch update for the high-level security risk found and reported by [Shahrir Shafie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahrir-shafie-884293117) in the vulnerable API endpoints.

We categorized this vulnerability as a Severe level issue and recommend everyone to update the system ASAP.

> Note the issue is affecting all the older version of the system, if in any case you are not able to update the system, we request you to get in touch with support and get your system patched.


|====================================================
|   v4.6.1
|====================================================
This is a quick hotfix update for the issues found in v4.6.0. This fixes various UI and functional issues which were introduced in v4.6.0.

### Bug Fixed
- Removed broken language from languages 
- Activating Custom JS results in breaking of the sidebar in the Admin panel
- While importing users from LDAP, CSV the location was not mapping correctly
- Various hyperlinks corrected in UI
- Various UI issues in SPA


|====================================================
|   v4.6.0
|====================================================
Faveo v4.6.0 is bundled with various updates and feature enhancements to improve the performance and experience of the agents with the application. This release focuses on improving the loading speed of the Agent panel which is the most used panel in the system along with security updates in login and various other bug fixes.

## What's new?
  - ### Agent Panel SPA Conversion
     We are continuously working on updating the application and use the latest web techniques to improve the overall experience of the users. Since we have been working on integrating Vue Js in our frontend codebase it also allows us to convert our application into a Single Page Application. SPA interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. It improves the page loading speed as the application only loads the part of the page or data which needs to be updated instead of reloading the whole page. We are converting different components of the application to work as SPA.
The client panel is already a SPA and in v4.6.0 we are rolling the SPA in the Agent panel. Since the Agent Panel is mostly used space in the application we hope this update will enhance the experience and productivity of your agents. Here's how the SPA looks in action.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Agent Panel with Reloading</td>
     <td>Agen Panel SPA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/124232136-e57bb380-db2e-11eb-9f6f-52d5a086441d.gif" width=100% height=350></td>
    <td><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/124232208-ff1cfb00-db2e-11eb-9932-5401172e312c.gif" width=100% height=350></td>
  </tr>
 </table>
    We will soon convert the Admin Panel into SPA too so we can deliver a smooth experience on the navigation to different panels in the system.

  - ### Popular Articles In KB
     A knowledge base is a place where the end-users and customers search for solutions to their problems. Having a good KB with proper articles saves time for both your customers and Agents. Because the customers find the solution by themselves without burdening your agents with small queries or FAQs. A good KB contains solutions to all such questions in an organized manner so they are easy to find. In this update, we are rolling **Popular Articles** visibility so your users can easily navigate to the articles which are popular and common among your customers. 
![Knowledgebase lists - Ladybird Web Solution](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/124230374-87e66780-db2c-11eb-85d9-ff09e30e5f5d.png)


 - ### Login Logs for security
    Security is the major concern among the users. We at Faveo are constantly trying to increase the security measures in the application to protect the system against any attack. Since application login is the most common target for the attackers we have made few updates in the system to secure the login for your agents and users. Options and settings can be enabled by admins for all users and by the users individually for their profiles.
![Screenshot 2021-07-02 at 12 39 13 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/124235248-a18aad80-db32-11eb-9cf1-4d70b6c455c0.png)
    - #### Login Logs
      The system now maintains the logs for all login and failed login attempts made by users. These logs can be used to identify any potential brute force on login for user accounts.
    - #### Login Alerts 
      The system will now send alerts to users on new login attempts so that they can be notified if somebody tries to log in to their account repeatedly. If the user logs in from a different browser, system, or network which they do not use usually then the system will send an email with the information as below
![Screenshot 2021-07-02 at 12 51 44 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/124236919-9a649f00-db34-11eb-9e2a-81ab3c2114b1.png)

    - #### Logout from all devices
      Now when the user changes their password or logs out from the system they will have the choice to discard the session on all other devices from which they have logged in to the system. If they opt for logging out from all the devices system will immediately invalidate all their current active sessions and tokens.

## Updates
  - ### Adhoc Approvals
     In the last release, we introduced Adhoc approvals to allow the approver in the approval workflow dynamically on ticket creation. In this release, we have made the feature more intuitive to make the feature more useful.

  - ### Updates in Ticket PDF Generation
     The system currently allows the agents to generate the PDF of the ticket. But the generated PDF does not contain the complete information of the tickets. So we have tweaked the functionality which now allows users to select more details to include in the generated PDF.
![Screenshot 2021-07-02 at 1 04 45 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/124238340-17444880-db36-11eb-86db-98df34619a28.png)


  - ### Multiple visibility support for tags
    Since we added the visibility option in the tags in previous releases we found that the support for multiple visibility was not functioning correctly. We have fixed the issues with the functionality and the visibility for tags should be working as expected now.

  - ### Vue Conversion
    In continuous efforts of converting the application into the Vue component, we are constantly updating different modules to Vue. Although these changes are hard to notice we are still listing them so you can check them and let us know if you find any difference in those modules. This release converts the below-listed modules to Vue components
    -  Custom JS plugin
    - Error and debugging
    - Department 
    - Module page
    - Source settings page
    - Queue driver settings

## Bugs Fixed
  - Tags visibility issue in ticket timeline
  - CC replies are being denoted as agent reply
  - Bill module Seeder issue with a custom field for packages
  - All custom fields are not loading in custom field filter options 
  - Ambiguity clarified in auto-close workflow working
  - Various minor bugs and UI Issues

## ChangeLogs
Since we converted different modules in Vue Js, we also made changes in the way we were handling the deletion process for such resources. Deletion of resources is a complicated function of the system. As the resource may be linked to many other resources. For example, a department can be linked in Workflow, Listeners, SLA, recurring tickets, ticket filters, etc. So if you delete such a department there are different cases in which the system was not handling properly. But now we have come up with a generic implementation that helps us to delink such resources properly without affecting much of your system configurations.
- Now after the update, if you delete such resource then it will be replaced with the default value for that resource in all the dependencies.
- If you have already deleted such resources before the update their link to all the dependencies will be removed to keep the database clean. Once you update then deletion of such resources will work as stated above.

>Note: Department and source are such resources in this update and the linking and deletion will be handled as mentioned. So we d not recommend updating the system without taking backup.

Hotfix release for critical bugs in workflow/listeners and SLA

We have squashed the critical bug we found in the last release. Workflow, SLA and listeners will be working without errors now.

|====================================================
|   v4.3.0
|====================================================
We have bundled various enhancements and feature updates in v4.3.0 to make the Faveo Helpdesk better and more useful for businesses to support their customer issues in a better-organized manner. Along with new updates, v4.3.0 also provides patches for various pesky bugs.

### Updates
- #### Form Builder updates
The custom form builder is an essential and critical module of Faveo that allows customizing the system as per your industry and gather all required information from your customers so that agents can solve the issues effectively and efficiently. We have made various improvements in the Form builder components that work behind the scenes in the system. Though we do not have anything to show off for Form Builder using screenshots or screencast GIFs but rest assured the Form builder has improved a lot.

* #### Distinct Ticket Activity logs
In Faveo, agents and clients can perform various actions on the ticket other than replying to the tickets. Though Faveo already had logs for maintaining all such activities performed by different users on the tickets but those logs were very basic and showed limited information. It somewhat helped to analyze the actions taken on the tickets but still resulted in ambiguity and confusion to identify all changes on the tickets and what caused them. 
Keeping all these challenges in mind we are releasing better and more detailed **Ticket activity logs** which help to identify those changes. These new activity logs can support to identify
&nbsp;&nbsp;  * Which workflows/listeners were enforced on the tickets.
&nbsp;&nbsp;  * Which update caused the SLA update
 
Additionally, we have moved all activities logs into different tab that removes the noise from the timeline of conversations and helps agents to focus on replies made by clients or other agents.
![ticket-activity-log](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/102046024-7348b900-3e00-11eb-83ff-90df30013046.gif)


- #### Improved file manager
We have changed the file manager used in the system to attach or upload attachments on the tickets, Knowledge base articles, and other places in the system. Now when you upload a file using the "Add media" or "Attachment" option new file manager will appear as shown in the image below
![Screenshot 2020-12-14 at 10 59 58 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/102043899-b18fa980-3dfb-11eb-8e68-20b158671a79.png)
As you can see in the image above the new file manager is full of rich options that allow you to handle user uploaded files and attachments in the system in a better way. 


- #### Admin panel Vue conversion
To achieve our goal to make Faveo faster and optimized. We are continuously working on implementing the latest technologies in the system. After converting the client panel of Faveo into Vue we are now transferring our focus to converting agent and admin into Vue so we can provide the same seamless experience to the agents who actually use the system day in and day out to serve your business. This update converts various settings pages in the Admin panel into Vue.

|====================================================
In this version, we have updated our editor interface and changes our WYSIWYG editor to [TinyMCE Community](https://www.tiny.cloud/get-tiny/self-hosted) for a better experience so your agents can maintain KB articles and express themselves creatively. Along with this it also fixes various minor bugs that do not break your system but still give us nightmares.

### Updates
- TinyMCE Editor added
TinyMCE is a widely used rich text editor on the internet. We have added TinyMCE editor to enhance your experience so you can format your reply to clients, KB articles, and most places that use text area as you like.

NOTE: As the editor has been changed you might encounter few changes while editing existing KB articles. So we request you to check all the Articles and save their image

- Active Directory location mapping
Now LDAP plugin integration allows you to map users with their AD location in Faveo. So the location of users can also be imported and mapped in the system via LDAP.

- CRTWorkflow Plugin
CRTWorkflow is short for creating tickets via workflow. This plugin allows the admin to create new tickets via workflow. It links recur tickets with workflow so when it is enabled admin can select the recur tickets in workflow action. If the workflow with recur action gets enforced system will create new tickets with the details available in the recur ticket.

|====================================================
Following the updates, in v4.0 we have updated the looks and style of the Faveo UI by updating the frontend theme AdminLTE to the latest version. Faveo v4.1.0 also updates bootstrap and other UI libraries being used in the system. It also provides fixes for some major bugs in the system.

### Updates
- #### New look for admin and agent panel
v4.1.0 updates AdminLTE and bootstrap version which changes the look of the system. Though all the elements are at the same place as before the update in the theme makes them look new and more interesting.
- #### Manage tasks via workflow
Now you can create and append tasks on the ticket using workflows. In workflow action, you can define to link a ticket with a set of tasks that are enforced if the ticket satisfies the certain conditions and rules you set in the workflow.
- #### Update tags/labels and requester via workflow
Similarly, we have added new actions in the workflow which allows you to add new tags/labels and also update the requester of the ticket using workflows. 
- #### Search requester with organisation name

So if you know someone is from an organization called "Google" in the system but you do not recall their name while creating the ticket you can simply type "Google" in the requester field and you will be provided with the list of all the members of that organization in the system.
- #### Attach Assets on ticket creation
If you use ServiceDesk to manage your IT assets, many times you want to mention an asset or link an asset with the ticket which has the issues. While in the older version you had to link the assets after creating the ticket. This update provides a field called "Assets" in the ticket form which allows users to link the assets on the ticket while creating a ticket.

Twitter plugin update now allows you to reply back to tweets directed to your account from the system. 
- #### Add description during forwarding a ticket

For technical changelog see https://github.com/ladybirdweb/faveo-helpdesk-advance/blob/master/ChangeLogs.md#v410

|====================================================
|   v4.0.1
|====================================================
In v4.0.0 we had updated the Laravel framework's version to v6.18.34 which had some breaking changes the way the framework handles cookies and auth sessions. Which was causing the issues during auto-updating the application from older versions to v4.0.0. This release is a hotfix which fixes this issue by downgrading the Laravel version to v6.18.26 which is the last stable release for non-breaking changes.

### Bug fixes
- #### Auto-update failure due to session/cookie expiration fixed
Due to breaking changes in the framework updating the application from the auto-update module without taking backup results in the failure of the update. 

- #### Auto-update failure due to reCaptcha settings in the older versions
Additionally, if you had added reCaptcha in the older system and removed/deactivated, it again causes the failure in the update of the application.

- #### Recurring tickets do not create tickets
While creating recur tickets if you select start and end time as the same date then the system was failing to create the recurring tickets.

For technical changelog see https://github.com/ladybirdweb/faveo-helpdesk-advance/blob/master/ChangeLogs.md#v401


|====================================================
|   v4.0.0
|====================================================
This release introduces various major changes and improvements in the system. It updates the implementation of various modules to implement the correct business logic and remove any issues in the module.
As v4.0.0 suggests, this release contains various major changes which are backward-incompatible. So after updating to this version you will not be able to downgrade the system to the older versions.

## Updates

### Laravel Updates
Laravel framework has been updated to the latest releases version of the framework for v6.

### Facebook Plugin 2.0
Facebook plugin v2 has been developed which uses the latest messenger APIs for fetching the ticket and replying on the tickets and post reply back to Facebook.
In the older version, the old API and access permission for the APIs were misleading, and getting the approval for the Facebook app to use with Faveo was a tedious task. This new implementation with v7 APIs makes the process faster and less likely for your apps to get disapproved by the Facebook team.
This update also lets supports media attachment fetching in the ticket from Facebook. Ticket will be fetched with the attachments and you can share the files during replying on the tickets from Faveo. The files will be shared in the reply message on messenger to your clients.

### Support for Google reCaptcha v3
Faveo now supports invisible reCaptcha or reCaptcha v3 by google. In the settings page, you can select the version of reCaptcha you want to use and set up the reCaptcha on your system easily. Recaptcha settings also allow defining places to use reCaptcha like KB comments, login, etc.

### Azure AD support added
We have added additional support in the LDAP plugin to allow using Azure AD. Now you can setup Faveo to import users from you Azure AD and allow your users to login with their Azure account.

### Ticket number assignment
Few clients have reported and we found the rare cases where the same ticket number was being assigned to multiple tickets. It creates multiple duplicates tickets with the same number in the system. We have changed the ticket number settings to fix the issue.
Now in the ticket number setting you can only define the prefix to be used during assigning the id to the tickets. You can also decide and set this prefix for tickets in the workflow. So the tickets that match the workflow condition will have the custom number sequence which is set in the workflow. This allows you to manipulate ticket numbers according to different conditions and set different ticket numbers according to your requirement.

### Ambiguity in account activation and verification logic removed
For a long time, there was confusion in the status of the account in the system. Whether the account is active or verified it was hard to distinguish between them. It does not impact the user login and data in the existing system in any way but it's good that we have figured out the mystery and have it implemented correctly.
Now by default, all the accounts registered in the system will be set as active. No verification is required for activating the account. Agents can simply deactivate and activate the account according to the permission they have.
Verification is now at the entity level, which means that the account is neither verified nor non-verified, it's the email address or mobile number linked to the account which will be verified or non verified. Email/mobile will be verified by default bases on the way or channel from where the users are getting registered in the system. Agents can manually set email and mobile verified from the user's profile the same as before.

### Login and registration process corrected
We have been inspecting our codebase and correcting/refactoring different modules for correct implementation to make our life easier. Though it might not be important for you to know, we wanted to put it out so in case you face issues in log in you can contact us.

### Agents have regained their power
Agents can now again add internal notes on the tickets which they have requested. As in the last release, agents were restricted to not add internal notes on the tickets which they have requested as owner.

### Telephony Plugin v3
The telephony plugin has been updated to v3. Telephony plugin now uses websockets to send the alerts and information about the incoming calls to the logged in agents, if they get a call on their work number via IVR.
The simple popup appears when the call starts and ends with the information of the caller. Agents can add notes by clicking on the popup while they talk on the phone. At the end of the call they can simply create the new ticket for the call or add the call to an existing ticket of the user.

### User account deactivation and added user account deletion
Corrected the implementation of account deactivation in the system. We have also worked on the long requested feature of deleting the user account to make the system compliant with GDPR.

 - #### Account deactivation
Use account deactivation was already available in the system, but it has issues underneath. We worked to fix those issues and make the module more robust and better. Admin have to give permission to agents so that they can deactivate the users and agents. When the user/agents is being deactivated agent might have to select what should happen to the ticket requested by them or the tickets assigned to them.

 - #### Account deletion
Faveo now allows deleting the user account. Deleting users will delete all their personal information and files from the system, such as their contact details, tickets owned by them, the files and images uploaded by them. User account must be deactivated before it can be deleted. Similar to deactivation admin have to give permission to agents so that they can delete the users and agents

|   v3.5.0
|====================================================
This release introduces updates in the LDAP plugin to support multiple AD import. It also updates the task plugin and adds functionality to import users from CSV files.

### Updates
- #### Multiple AD support Added
Faveo LDAP plugin allowed importing users and login via LDAP used by your organization. While previously you could only import all users from single search base and LDAP directory this new update allows you to create multiple LDAP configurations to import and sync users from different directory service databases and with different filters in the same directory.
![Screenshot 2020-08-03 at 3 14 31 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/89170531-66d46a00-d59d-11ea-8963-26013f3c6ba5.png)

When you click on **Configure new LDAP** it will offer you with the same old settings page where you can define your LDAP connection configuration and other settings to filter users and import them to Faveo.

- #### User import via CSV files
    The system now allows importing users from CSV files. Admins can now upload CSV files containing user details and map each column with the user field in the system.
![Screenshot 2020-08-03 at 3 04 30 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/89168669-d137db00-d59a-11ea-8339-7daf83fd44af.png)

Once you map CSV files columns with user fields properly, you can proceed to import the users. The system will import the users in the background.

- #### Task plugin update
    Task plugin has been updated to support reminder alerts and also fixes various known issues in the plugin.
- #### Send feedback request from ticket timeline page
    New option to request feedback from the client has been added to the ticket timeline page. It sends an email requesting overall experience feedback to clients on their tickets.

### Tags in Knowledge Base
Faveo now allows users to add tags in the KB articles. Linking tags with articles will allow users to find similar articles by creating an additional grouping of similar articles using tags.
You can provide tags while creating or editing an article.
![Screenshot 2020-03-28 at 10 06 51 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/77814937-bd0b3b00-70db-11ea-8c52-2d21bd49ba93.png)

If any user clicks on the tag in KB article it will show the filtered KB articles which are linked to that tag.
![Screenshot 2020-03-28 at 10 07 49 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/77814960-f93e9b80-70db-11ea-811c-89081686948f.png)
 
### Improved Logs
System logs have been updated to show more information about the logged data or exception. UI has been updated to segregate filter options on the log level. Cron log has been improved to show the status of cron commands execution to simplify troubleshooting the issues with cron.
![logs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/77815052-c21cba00-70dc-11ea-8b25-e53a015c97b8.png)

### Twitter Plugin #Hashtag support
The Twitter plugin now supports Hashtags. It will fetch the tweets containing the specified hashtags and create tickets in the system. You can provide multiple hashtags to fetch tickets on the plugin settings page.
![hastag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/77815115-8d5d3280-70dd-11ea-9c82-412f9b3c9ce4.png)


## Updates

### Improved plugin settings page
We have changed the UI of the plugin setting page to make it simple to de/activate the plugins.
![plugin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/77815152-2724df80-70de-11ea-8293-1d082843b713.png)

### Secured probe page
Probe page has been secured with the passphrase for security reasons. Now once the system is installed you will need to enter the passphrase to access the probe page as it exposes information about PHP configuration on the server. The passphrase can be found in **.env** file.
![Screenshot 2020-03-28 at 10 31 00 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/77815212-c8139a80-70de-11ea-9e1e-e9c0ffd39dba.png)

### Change status dropdown list
Change status drop-down list now will respect Allow override statutes and will show the results only which are commonly allowed for the selected ticket in case of multiple tickets are selected.

### Improved installer
Faveo GUI installer has been improved and simplified to make the installation experience simple and better.

### Autoupdate refinements


### Laravel v6.18.2
The Laravel framework has been updated to v6.18.2. As Laravel 7 has been released the team will now focus on updating the framework version to 7.X.

## Bug fixes
v3.2.0 squashes various major and minor outstanding bugs and issues in the system. Here we are listing some important bugs which are squashed and probably make you happy to know that they no longer exist.
* The organization logo not visible on the view page or not able to edit the organization due to the organization logo file is now fixed.
* Made language file consistent to make the text on UI consistent.
* Last login time of the user to show the correct login time
* Telephony audio recording not working
* Issues with email fetching and sending
* Various UI bugs and minor bugs
* Issues with approvers in Approval workflow and CAB
* Fixed gravatar image
* Issues with Laravel queue after updating now restating supervisor workers is not required
* Refreshing CSRF token in the backend
* KB search does not work on the words less than 5 characters
* Issue in exporting reports

## Deprecated/Removed

### Deprecated old dashboard layout
Though you can switch to the old dashboard layout we recommend you encourage your agents to use the new dashboard to make themselves familiar with it as the old dashboard will be removed completely in the upcoming releases.

### Removed old inbox layout
We have removed the old inbox layout from the system, now you can no longer switch to the old inbox layout.

### Removed ban user
Ban use functionality has been removed as it was not adding any value to the system and might be not being used by many of Faveo users.

### Removed Close approval workflow
Close approval workflow used to add an extra step of approval before an agent can close the ticket. If close approval workflow is enabled and the agent tries to close the ticket it used to send the ticket in the request for close status and notify the department manager about the action. The department manager then could approve or deny the closing request for the ticket. 
As the same functionality now can be achieved using **Approval workflow** and **Listeners** we have removed the Close approval workflow.

### Removed old social plugin
As we have introduced separate new plugins for Facebook and Twitter we have removed the social plugin.

|====================================================
|   v3.0.0
|====================================================
Faveo Helpdesk v3 introduces various enhancements and improvements to make your support system better and more secure. In this release, we have improved the system on various aspects from security to performance and business logic implementation.

## What's new?

### Multi-factor authentication
As our dependency on the internet is increasing day by day, we are becoming more comfortable yet more vulnerable on the internet. One of the major threats on the internet is getting the account hacked by attackers. This can be due to people use simple and same passwords for various online platforms.

Multi-factor authentication was introduced as an added layer for securing the login process. In the process of log in the user must provide a private code with their username and password that can only be accessed by them over their phones.

In Faveo we have introduced 2FA login which an individual can enable from his/her profile. Once the 2FA is enabled, whenever the users log in they have to provide a secret code that they can access on their phones using 2FA authentication apps like **Authy** or **Google authenticator**.

#### 2FA setup process

![ezgif com-optimize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/73061399-1ed2dd00-3ec0-11ea-8713-242f05f735fe.gif)

#### 2FA login process
![ezgif com-optimize (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/73061600-8b4ddc00-3ec0-11ea-8b06-d9302f6082aa.gif)

### Projects in tasks plugin

We also updated the task plugin and introduced **Projects** and **TaskLists** which can help you to manage your projects and related task from your helpdesk support system itself. We also changed the UI of the plugin to give it a similar look like other modules. New plugin now
 - Allows to create and manage projects
 - Allows to create task lists and link them with tasks and projects.
 - Allows to create tasks

### Add collaborators in client panel ticket view

If your customers raise tickets and reply to the ticket using the client portal then they might want to add a new collaborator on the ticket while updating the ticket. Also if a user is a collaborator in another user's ticket then they might want to see or update it from the client portal which was not possible in the older versions. But in version 3 we have added this functionality to just give an additional option to your customers.
- CC users of tickets can view tickets and reply to the ticket from the client panel.
- Clients can add new CC users or remove CC users from client panel

### Revamped SLA modules

We have completely revamped the SLA module of the system from its looks to its working. SLA has been improved and optimized for helping you to manage your support system's SLAs. So you can increase your customer base by providing timely support to your customers.

#### Improved SLA UI
We have changed the functionality of the SLA and to make the options easy to understand in new SLA we have rearranged the options in SLA create/edit page.
![SLA_edit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/73063975-1da4ae80-3ec6-11ea-8897-e8c40138c0e9.png)

#### Improved SLA enforcements
The old SLA enforcement process was hard to explain. If anyone asked us how and why this particular SLA has been enforced on the ticket it would take us hours which are directly proportional to the number of SLAs available in their system. This made us rethink the implementation of the SLA enforcement process and we did not waste any time to change the implementation of the SLA. We hope new SLA enforcements will be easy to understand so you can plan your SLA policies better and know why that particular SLA has been applied to the ticket. To see the new working process of SLA search our knowledge base for SLA.

#### Improved SLA reminders
As we have changed the SLA module completely, this includes the reminder and escalation alerts too. Now the system will not skip sending any notifications to you before the ticket gets overdue or no-one responses on the ticket.

NOTE: Version 3 has remarkable updates so once you update the system to version 3 you can not downgrade it to an older version.

For technical changelog see https://github.com/ladybirdweb/faveo-helpdesk-advance/blob/master/ChangeLogs.md

|====================================================
|   v2.3.0
|====================================================
At Faveo we always seek to provide our users with the latest updated tech and functionalities which are available in the market. Keeping our tech stack updated also helps us to serve our clients with an efficient and secure product. Faveo is based on the Laravel framework and uses various frameworks for frontend. We always try to keep our base framework updated to ensure we deliver all the latest updates and security patches.

PHP has released PHP7.4, PHP7.3 is already being used to serve many web applications over the internet. Laravel has released version 6 which is the latest major version released by Laravel developers.

In Faveo v2.3.0 we have updated the framework version to Laravel 6 also made the code compatible with PHP 7.3.  Along with updating frameworks we also improved some existing functionalities and fixed some bugs.

## Enhancements
### Implemented CKEditor 5
The rich text editor is the core of Faveo. It allows agents to send a reply to clients, create useful articles and store predefined templates for a reply. All this is possible due to an interactive text editor provided by CKEditor. To further improve your typing experience we have updated our editors with CKEditor 5. It has a new design and it also lets you upload any image simply by copying and pasting it from your computer after all who does not like to ⌘+c and ⌘+v (ctlr+c and ctrl+v for windows)

### Improved reports
Past and next few releases of Faveo are about Reports because analyzing the HelpDesk data should be interesting and useful for management. v2.3.0 provides various updates in the reports which allow you to 
- Define the format for you custom columns which contain date or timestamps
- Select different chart layout for reports
- View the data categorized in improved widgets

### System backups
System backup allows taking backup of the system including files and databases. Just tell the system to generate a backup for you and continue your day. The system will trigger you a mail when the backup is ready. No more SSH and writing scripts for generating backups.

### PHP 7.3 support
Faveo is now compatible with PHP 7.3, so go ahead and update your PHP version for good.

## Bug Fix
- EWS mail fetching and related issues
- Agent performance redirection issue fixed
- ServiceDesk plugin issues
- Plugin schedule commands still visible when the plugin is disabled

## Changelog
- Updated Laravel version to v6.10.1.

> NOTE: As bootstrap, resources have not been updated on our CDN servers users are requested to disable the CDN to serve resource files from their own servers until the next update. 

|====================================================
|   v2.2.7
|====================================================
This release reintroduces change requester and users deactivate functionality in the system. It also offers separate plugins for Facebook and Twitter channels to manage the plugins without hassle.

### Updates
#### Facebook Plugin
The Facebook plugin allows admin to connect one Facebook app to Faveo using the app's API credentials. Once the app is connected with Faveo then admin can create their Facebook page(s) and integrate those pages with Faveo to read and respond on the page messages from Faveo. Messages from all linked Facebook pages will be fetched as tickets and reply made via Faveo ticket timeline will be sent as a reply on Facebook. The new plugin offers better UI to manage and link Facebook pages with Faveo and handles your Facebook conversation more accurately.

#### Twitter Plugin
Same as Facebook we introduced the new Twitter plugin to handle tweets and messages from twitter in a better way. The new plugin allows integrating one developer account app using which Faveo can fetch tweets or direct messages and allows agents to respond to them without logging into logging on Twitter.

#### Helpdesk-In depth Report
In order to improve reporting in Faveo, we have been rewriting our reporting module. This release provides the update for the Helpdesk-in depth report to serve more accurate data for your Helpdesk analysis report.

####  User deactivation and change owner
In past releases, we had removed the User deactivation option and change the requester button to stabilize the codebase. But due to the importance of these functionalities, we have reintroduced these functionalities again in the system.

#### Bug fixes
- Inline images are not being fetched
- Corrected logic for a department manager in the approval workflow
- secured 'API/agent/ticket-details' endpoint

#### Changelog

|====================================================
Feature updates

V2.0.1 enhances and provides updates for various features of the system.

## New features
### Ticket Forwarding
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system now allows agents to forward the complete ticket thread via emails. Agents can enter single/multiple email addresses to forward the ticket. It will be useful in cases when you want to share the thread with the third party members without enforcing them to be a part of the ticket.

### Ticket creator field
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New creator field has been added which shows who created the ticket. Most of the time when agents create a ticket for a client system shows the client as a requester of the ticket but there was no information about which agent created the ticket or the client created the ticket themselves. The creator field will solve this issue and tell the actual creator of the ticket.

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filters in inbox and management report also allow filtering the data based on this new field.

   ### Email templates for the department
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faveo uses predefined mail templates for sending email alerts and notifications to users via emails. These templates are editable and can be replicated for creating templates for different languages. So that the users receive emails in their preferred language.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have added the functionality to link template sets with a department which will be used to send notifications emails when any activity happens on the ticket of the department linked to that particular template set.

The previous precedence for the template picked by the system was as shown below
> User's preferred language template set **>** system's language template set **>** default template set

Current update will change template picking preference as below
>User's preferred language and department template set **>** User's preferred language template set **>** system's language and department template set **>** system's language template set **>** default template set

   ### Lanugage Migration Plugin(for internal usage)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An internal plugin to generate language keys with missing translation for a given language which can be later given to translators for translation.

## Updates
### Recurring tickets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recurring ticket allows admin to define a ticket which will be created periodically in certain intervals. While previously this feature can only be used by admin, now agents will also be able to create recurring tickets in the system. However, they will only be able to access their own recurring ticket and will not be able to update system recurring tickets(created by admins) or other agent's recurring tickets. Apart from this, there are a few more updates which are listed below
- Improved data table for showing available recurring tickets.
- Give a name to your recurring event so it will be easy to recognize and edit them later.
- Define execution time for a recurring event. Which means if you want a recurring ticket to be created daily at 2:30 PM now you can set the time for the execution for the recurring event and system will create the ticket at 2:30 PM irrespective of the execution time of recurring cron;

### SLA
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SLA updated for simplifying and centralized backend code
### Approval Workflow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added approval removal functionality and option to select organization managers as approver of levels and approval workflows.
### Listeners
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added option to apply approval workflow in listeners actions.

### Bug Fixes
* Updated email validation
* Ticket preview issue fixed
* Inbox type filter issue fixed
* Datatable UI issue fixed
* Tickets table page number issue fixed
* Ckeditor spellcheck option updated
* Bugs in the approval workflow
* Removed ticket number from the subject while merging the ticket

|====================================================
|   v2.0.0
|====================================================
Vue is a new view

Since Vue is rising its popularity among frontend and full-stack developers, we have started rewriting the code which renders on the client side using Vue for various reasons.

First and foremost it has better compatibility with the Laravel framework which is the core of our application. It also allows us to rewrite small parts of the application, convert them into Vue and release without affecting the whole application or rewriting complete frontend code which may take an eternity.

Version 2.0.0 is our next step towards converting the application into Vue. It converts various parts of the application into Vue integrated modules. Which means we had to make various changes in backend and frontend code. These updates modify the code of some core functions of the application thus the release is tagged as v2.0.0. Although, we tried to make these updates backward compatible with the older version there are few functions and APIs which are not backward compatible after all good things come with some price.

## Changelog

#### Form builder
- All tickets, user, and organizations form builders have been converted to Vue with changes in backend logic to save these customized forms in the database.
- API to get these forms to render and submit have been updated.

#### Forms rendering
- All customized forms of tickets, users and organizations will be rendered as Vue components in agent/admin/client panel.
- Ticket recur, fork and edit form also uses Vue components.

#### Workflows and Listeners
- Workflows and Listeners CRUD has been rewritten with Vue components.
- Workflow enforcements have been updated. Now instead of enforcing the first workflow system will enforce all matching workflows and the final result will contain the last updated values  enforced by last workflow (same goes for listeners)

## How will it impact?

**System** :
- We've refactored and cleaned unnecessarily complex code system will be able to process the request for ticket creation, reply on tickets, etc faster and efficiently.
- All the system related functionalities such as fetching emails, sending notifications, etc will continue to work without interruption.
- As workflow and listeners have few updates in their working it will affect old workflow and listeners in the system.

**Admin/Agents** :
- Admin/Agents will be able to use the system the same as before, the only difference is with the pages which render in the browser will be Vue compiled components.

- Admin/Agents can now view the custom data of the ticket in the single click.

- Admin/Agents can now edit tickets in a single click without opening a separate ticket detail page which opens in a double click on the tickets names.

- As workflow and listeners work slightly different now so Admin might need to recreate their workflows and listeners.

- In some cases, the admin may require to recreate the forms in the system.

**End User** :
- As client panel had already been converted to Vue in the previous version clients will be interacting with the Helpdesk system the same as before.

- Registration page and create ticket page were in Angular js and needed to load a new page previously. Now they have been converted to Vue and will open without redirection or page reload.

**Developers** :
* Since Vue is an easy to learn open source framework with a fairly active community frontend developers can now write components which can be reused in the application by other developers.
* Form builder component is much better than the one written in Angular which gave nightmares to almost everybody who tried to get their hands dirty by editing it.
* Clean backend code with less complexity will help new developers to read and understand the existing code and modify or write new methods without breaking existing functionality.

> Note: All new fixes and enhancements hereafter will be implemented in the updated codebase. The updates will be made available to clients after ensuring the smooth transition of their system from the older versions to v2.0.0 or greater.

Plus we also want to build the community of developers who can innovate and integrate their work in Faveo. Dynamic navigation implementation helps us to achieve both.
     Now users can easily navigate to different pages like inbox, knowledge base etc browsing from the sidebar all. Developers can use Navigation helper classes to add their pages in the sidebar navigation list.

  * ### Autoupdate
    Although this feature had been introduced in the previous versions, we could not make it reliable and easy for users to update their system using this feature. After updating our billing system recently we have made changes on how we handle licensing for different editions of Faveo.
    We want to make the experience of the users to update their system simple and precise so they do not have to wait for updating their system whenever a new update is released. In order to achieve this, we have reworked on the auto-update module and users will be able to update their system using this feature in the near future.

|====================================================
Bug Fixes

Fixed manual activation of the user account by agents. The issue was only happening when the agent user was trying to activate user accounts from the user profile view page.

|====================================================
|   v1.9.51
|====================================================

This release contains the patches for various logical bugs in the system for different functionalities. It also introduces some new features like **Close waiting time** and **Approvals via workflow**.

### Features

- #### Close waiting time
  Many a times client may reply on the old ticket which they have created before a month or a long time ago. There are possibilities that the client replied on the old ticket for a completely new query after the old issue is resolved. This will make it difficult for system users like agent and admins to track the issues raised by the client for different problems as they are replying on the same old thread.
Some companies also want to restrict users response on the closed tickets after a certain time period. Close waiting time allows admin to define a time period till which a client can reply on an old ticket and reopen the same ticket. If the client replied on the old ticket after a defined closed waiting time system will automatically redirect the request to a new ticket and create a new ticket for it.

- #### Approvals via Workflow
Faveo has approvals module which allows defining various approvals on different levels to accommodate the different process of an organization and its department. While in the previous versions agents had to manually apply for the approvals on tickets; now admin can define a workflow which will check for certain conditions to be true in the tickets and then enforce an approval on the ticket. If they match the criteria system will apply for the selected approval on that ticket.

### Bug fixes
- Login page redirection issue in blade files.
- Autoclose module working issue.
- Unable to change default SLA of the system.
- Mobile number validation issue in user view
- CC user duplication issue
- Language images not loading in client panel.
- Email fetch creating duplicate tickets issue.
- Arabic characters missing in the ticket fetched from outlook/office365.
- CLI installer removed order key check.


|====================================================
|   v1.9.50
|====================================================
This release enhances system logs with advanced options to help users or system admin to analyze and troubleshoot any issue occurring in the production environment. It also adds Laravel Horizon which is Laravel's queue monitoring tool which provides a beautiful dashboard to monitor system's background jobs processed in the queue.

### New System Logs

New and advanced System logs provide an organized and beautiful view which provides comprehensive yet easy to understand logs. These logs will be helpful for users/system admins or even Faveo team to analyze what's going in the system and will make it faster to identify and troubleshoot the issues.

  System logs are categorized as below

    Exception logs: All error and exception related logs will be logged here, so when system behaves abnormally you might want to check these logs for finding out the problem or cause of the problem.

    Cron Logs: Faveo has various iterative commands and tasks which it runs using crontab or task schedulers. Next time when the system stops fetching emails or creating recurring tickets these logs may save a few minutes or hours to fix the issue.

    Email logs: Faveo sends and receives emails via system configured mails. These logs will provide complete insight into the email functionality of the system. It will help the user to understand which emails have been fetched in the system, what notifications or alerts emails have been sent out and to whom. All this information will be handy to track system's interaction with the mail server and related activities.

  How to access

  Go to admin panel >System Logs and debugging>System logs

### Laravel Horizon

Faveo uses Queue functionality to process time-consuming or bulk jobs in the background such as sending emails for various user actions like ticket submission or forget password etc. It helps the system to send a quick response to the client to improve their experience on Helpdesk portal. Nobody likes slow or unresponsive webpages when the server is processing their request and doing other various jobs simultaneously. Laravel makes it easy to handle these jobs and push them in a queue so they can be processed in the background.
Laravel Horizon is an open source tool which provides a beautiful dashboard to monitor and manage all jobs which are pushed in the queue. It shows real-time information of the jobs which are being pushed in the queue or being processed or failed while processing. It also provides throughput metrics with information like thee the number of pushed jobs, failed jobs, max runtime of a job etc. It also allows retrying processing of failed jobs.

  How to access

  Go to admin panel >System Logs and debugging>Queue Monitor

### Bug fixes

  * Email template issue fix when agent create the ticket for himself/author-agent then that agent does not receive ticket creation acknowledgment mail
  * System does not pick system default language's template set to send the email notification to users when system default language is not English.
  * Department-status link working in ticket timeline page on double click.
  * Report data getting distorted when exporting management reports.
  * 2019 option to add media modal popup in recurring tickets.
  * database: sync command issue for updating database
  * Handled 404 exception due to calling the URL which does exist in the system using the POST method.
  * LDAP search base allows more than 10 entities.
  * Various UI issues

|====================================================
|   v1.9.49
|====================================================
Hot fix patch

This release provides fixes for some critical issues in the system.

## Bug Fixed

### 2019 Missing?
In add media modal popup's year drop-down list does not show 2019, which makes it difficult to filter out the files which are uploaded in 2019.

### Rating templates shortcodes
Updated system to be able to use more shortcodes in ticket rating and rating confirmation emails to pass more details of tickets such as ticket number, ticket subject etc. in the email.

### Debugbar visibility
In recent updates, the system was not showing debug bar when APP_DEBUG mode is enabled. Also in logs system was logging `production.ERROR: Debugbar exception: Route [debugbar.assets.css] not defined` when running the application. We have made changes in web.php (commit id #db7c7d7fd2f45587e5eb4233d74cad4c8ca45ef0) to fix the issue https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar/issues/387 as per this solution
https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar/issues/387#issuecomment-137487228. As the package has been updated we no longer need this code snippet in web.php and it solves the issue of visibility of debugging bar and error logging.

|====================================================
|   v1.9.48
|====================================================
This release focuses on new features to improve existing functionalities of the system. It introduces CDN enable disable option, report download page and other options which makes the existing functionalities more useful for the users. It also updates the Laravel version to the latest released version of the framework.

## Change Log

### Enhancements
- #### CDN enable/disable option
  Content Delivery Networks widely known as CDN have geographically distributed servers which respond to the requests based on location allowing faster delivery of the resources like images, stylesheets and javascript files. We started hosting resource files of Faveo on our CDN servers allowing your application to handle and respond to the resource requests faster through the nearest server.

  If the user doesn't wish to use resources hosted on CDNs then they can disable the CDN option from the system settings page. It will force the system to handle resource requests and deliver resource files from the same server where the application is hosted. It can be useful if the system is being used in intra network and client machines are not allowed to access resources over the internet.

- #### Report Export download page
  Did not receive the mail after exporting a report from Management reports?
  We have added a new page where you can see and download all your exported reports. Now even if you miss the mail you can still download the report you exported to analyze your system working.

- #### Failure of jobs
  Though we try to ensure that Faveo handles all jobs processed by users without failure. But we have limitations as Faveo is a self-hosted application and most of the times we are not controlling the system which is hosted on user's server. We have added an option in alert and notices which can be used to notify agents/admins about the errors and exceptions occurred in the system. The feature is in early stage and currently it only handles failures occurred during processing of background jobs like exporting reports, creating recur tickets etc.

- #### LDAP package update
  Updated ADLDAP package used in LDAP plugin

- #### Select status which allows auto-closing the ticket
  Faveo has auto-close ticket workflow which closed the tickets automatically after a defined period if the agent had replied on it and there is no response from the client. Previously if you enabled this workflow system would close all the ticket which has last response from agents after a defined period. Which can be troublesome if you are waiting for a response from a 3rd party as the system will close the ticket irrespective of the status.

  New settings in close ticket workflow setting will allow admins to select the list of statuses which allow the system to close tickets automatically. While executing the auto-close process system will check the ticket's status against the list of selected statuses. If the ticket's status matches with any of the statuses from the list then the system will check old conditions to close the ticket and if all conditions satisfy then the system will close the ticket automatically.

- #### Billing updates
  Updated Faveo billing and licensing validation checks to prevent unauthentic usage of the application on client servers without knowledge of Faveo team.

- #### Laravel upgrade
Upgraded Laraved version to 5.7

### Bug Fixes
- Fix redirection issue.
- Ticket body jumbled up
- Cron settings page required field issue
- IE compatibility issue on creating ticket page introduced in the last release
- Updated billing verification link
- Fixed title issue while merging tickets

|====================================================
|   v1.9.45
|====================================================

### Bug fixes and updates

* **Updated installer:** Updated installer to open probe.php files in the first step to check server environment as laravel route does not load up when system permissions are not correct giving no information about the issue. So putting the system check in simple PHP script will allow the system to check server configuration before giving control to Laravel.
* **Email verification screen is back:** When a user who has not activated his/her account logs into the system, he will be notified to activate the account using the link they received in their mailbox. They are also presented with the option to resend the activation link or update their email before activating the account.
* **Daily report mails issue** Due to the last update in cron settings daily report emails were not going out, which we have fixed in this update.
* **Envato Plugin refinements:** Updated Envato plugin to fix the issues in the plugin
* **LDAP updates:** Added custom port option to connect with LDAP plugin.
* **Fixed client layout** Client layout renders in default theme even after changing the layout colours.
* **Merged template for registration and activation:** In alerts settings now user can select whether they want to send different emails to newly registered users for **registration confirmation** and **account activation** or just a single mail with the merged template.
* **Duplicate ticket numbers issue:** While processing recurring ticket creation jobs system was assigning same ticket numbers to multiple tickets. This patch update will fix the issue by dispatching the recur ticket create jobs on a separate queue. Please note to fix the issue the supervisor configuration needs to be updated.
* **Management report export issue:** Fixed management report issue by updating the export job process and dispatching the job on a separate queue. Please note to fix the issue the supervisor configuration needs to be updated.
* Other UI updates


|====================================================
|   v1.9.44
|====================================================
This release introduces some major updates and features in the system. It updates the Laravel framework to v5.6.39 along with some new features and functionalities in some existing modules.

### Enhancements
  - **Approval workflow module(new)**
    Approval workflow introduces new functionality in the system which allows you to create multiple workflows with multiple levels. You can decide who will approve each level and for each level, you can choose to get approval from multiple people with approval required from all or any of them. Once you have created your workflows with different levels, you can later apply these workflows on the tickets from ticket detail page. When any workflow is applied on a ticket, all approver of level 1 will receive an email to approve or deny the requested ticket and that particular ticket will become unapproved and only privileged agents will be able to perform selected actions on it. Approvers can use the unique link they received in the mail to approve or deny the request without login to the application. Which makes it easy to get approval from the person who does not have an account in the system. If level 1 gets approved then the subsequent level will be enforced and approvers of that level will be notified and it will continue till all the levels defined in the workflow are passed and approved.

  - **Refinements in Language Module**
     * Rewritten methods in LanguageController
     * Updated LanguageMiddleware
  - **LDAP plugin updated with advanced options**
    * Now admin can map attributes from their AD to Faveo database's user table columns. It will allow you to define which column should be imported from your AD and in which column of users table the value should be saved.
  - **Refinements in Cron module**
    * Updated Console/Kernal class responsible for running scheduled artisan commands. Added helper methods for developers so they can handle and schedule their custom artisan commands for the custom module and package from itself.
    * Updated cron settings to let the user select to enable/disable all system's default and plugin's scheduled jobs.
    * Fixed "Daily at" field value to take time in user's system timezone by handling UTC conversion and expected timely execution on severing from the backend.
  - **SLA response flag**
    If the ticket is in halted SLA and response happens on the system by agent then system was not able to set a correct flag for response due. Now while halting SLA system stores the last estimated due date and uses it to set a flag for response due. If the ticket is in Halted SLA and response is done within last estimated due date then the response will be marked on time as true; false otherwise.
  - **Ticket creation with organization**
   As Favoe currently does not have direct linking between tickets and organization we have restricted linking of organization and tickets of users with the role as normal users. Which means you will not be able to create a ticket for internal users(agents/admins) and then link them to an organization.
  - Laravel framework version updated to v5.6.39
  - Updated SLA create/edit page UI
  - Updated Business hours create/edit page UI implemented in Vue.js

|====================================================
v1.9.33 introduces some major changes in the system. While some of them will enhance the user experience of the system, others will help us to optimize the system for better performance of the system. Here's the complete list of changes introduced in this release.

### Used Vue.js in more places
  We are updating the technology we are using in our system to ensure that the users are always using the system built using the best technology out there. As Vue has more advantages above normal JavaScript and HTML code, we are constantly converting the front end of the system into Vue to make the system modular.
    - We recently reworked on our whole client panel and implemented the same functionalities with Vue. It will enhance the experience of your customers on the Helpdesk portal.
    - Knowledge base also has been converted in Vue js with better performance and style.

### Updated email package
  We updated the email package we were using to perform mail fetching and mail sending process within the system.
  New email settings page in Vue with more options to control incoming and outgoing functionality.

### Add a note while changing status
  Change status now will give you an option to post a comment or reply on the ticket directly while changing the status of ticket.

### Add ticket owner to organization from ticket details page
  While checking a ticket if your realize that the owner of ticket belongs to an already existing organization in the system then you can link the owner to that organization directly from the ticket.

### Change status method rewritten
  Rewritten the method used for changing status of ticket by breaking it down in smaller function for better readability.

### Add custom fields to check enforcement of SLAs
  It enables you to add your custom fields which you created in ticket form to check for specific value. When any ticket created with that value in specified fields it will enforce the SLA. It'll be useful if you have a fully custom form which you created according to your business need and you want to enforce particular SLA for certain custom fields.

Faveo had introduced auto update functionality for the system so that our customers can easily update their system automatically whenever Faveo releases a new version, without getting in touch with Faveo support team. The idea behind auto-update is to provide end users with the option to update their system independently without waiting for Faveo Support team to update their system. Initial releases for auto-updates were not working properly and clients were not able to update their system by themselves. This release fixes all the issues with auto-update to ensure hassle free update of your system with the latest released version.


|====================================================
|   v1.9.26
|====================================================
This release is a hot fix release which handle missing scripts in the prevoius release regarding database updates and redis databse.

====================================================
|   V1.9.25
|====================================================

Faveo team is constantly working towards improving existing features in the application along with bug fixing and new enhancements to make the application faster and more user friendly, so you can support your customers easily and in a better way.

To make Faveo more stable and better our team has started inspecting existing features which are the essential part of any Helpdesk system and implementing improved logic to refine the functionality of those features.  There will be frequent releases to roll out those update patches for our customers and these release is the first step towards making our application more stable.

v1.9.25 introduces some improvement patches along with bug fixes.

## Improvements and changelog

### Rethink APIs
In earlier stages of our API development we missed out to follow proper structure for response and parameters. It might seem like a trivial problem but it prevents other developers and coders to integrate their application or use our APIs to build something on top of the Helpdesk. We've rethought this and rewritten our APIs to follow standards of REST APIs. It will allow other developers to collaborate with Faveo team and make new pluigns, to integrate other applications faster and better.
Along with rewriting the APIs we have introduced some new APIs for client users which can be used to access client panel functionality via APIs. To read more about the changes in API please follow our API document.

>**Please note**: Instead of creating new version of API to maintain old integrations our team has reworked on the same old APIs, changed response and parameter structure of the same old APIs(We are still learning). If you have used our APIs in your application, you might want to check the new changes in API to update your application accordingly.
> **Faveo Mobile apps have been updated and updates will be available for download on play store and app store soon**

### Rethink status change
* In a system when you put a ticket on **hold** status and waiting for client reply system will keep the status as **hold** until client replies back on the ticket or an agent manually updates the status.
* Introduced one new status **Unapproved** which will be only visible to certain agents/managers who have permission to see the tickets with this status. This will give you the power to review tickets before your agents see the tickets and start working on it.

### Rethink SLA Policy
Set **HALT SLA** option as *yes* for all default status other than Open as SLA clock should stop when a ticket is closed or deleted as agents are no longer working on those tickets. It helps to evaluate agents performance better and also gives a correct estimation of time spent on a ticket so you can bill your client accordingly.
> NOTE: Updating system will not change the HALT SLA option for existing status please do it manually by editing status to use in your system.

### Rethink reports
* Introduced new report for management teams of businesses which gives complete information of the tickets with data of custom fields raised in the system. This report can be filtered on different criteria and can be exported to excel sheet so management members can see overall system in a glance.
* Fixed issue for calculating *Resolution SLA* in agents and department performance reports.

### Rethink testing
As we want to stabilize the application and make Faveo a bug free product. We are implementing new development process in our team(thanks to our new team members). Each bug and functionality should be written with Unit tests cases, so we can catch the bug before it goes to our testers. It will help us to reduce the bugs in our system and reduce the time to test and release the code, so we can roll out more updates.

## Bug Fixes
* Fixed issues in status SMS sending option (SMS plugin)
* Introduced new templates for calendar plugin to send out task alerts in with specific information
* Fixed issues in status CRUD functionality
* Optimized admin layout by removing unnecessary JavaScript and CSS files.
* Fixed issues in Custom JS plugin (firing inactive scripts)
* Fixed case sensitivity issue in rule/condition check for workflow and listeners.

|====================================================
|   v1.9.24
|====================================================
In v1.9.23 we optimized and cleaned our code to make the system performance better and optimized ticket table to load data faster in ticket tables. There were few bugs which have been reported in v1.9.23 and this release resolves the severe bugs which may cause problems in the system.

## Bug Fixed
  - Issue with mail fetching or mail getting skipped from ticket thread
  - Fixed issue in creating tickets when ticket form has attachment fields
  - Handled exception in environment file values with spaces
  - Calendar plugin: My task in top navbar is not clickable
  - Ticket form attachment file size limit is chec
  - Updated message and picture in in-app notification for system activities
  - Stopped internal activity mail alerts with only "." in the message body

|====================================================
|   v1.9.23
|====================================================
v1.9.23 is all about performance optimization of the system and bug fixes for older versions.

## Enhancement for better performance
  - Optimized Ticket Tables
      You might have encountered the slow loading of ticket tables as data of customer tickets increase in the system. We have optimized these tables for better and faster experience using Laravel's Eloquent Relationships. It helped us to optimize query execution time and allow us to pass more relevant json data in API requests for getting tickets.

      * Default links for ticket tables will use new Relationship method to render ticket data in your table. If you want to load ticket tables using old query simply put `/old` in the URL of your ticket pages after `tickets`

  - Style sheet and script minification
      We have minified all external/3rd party CSS and JavaScript file along with loading only required scripts on every page to optimize page load time.

## Bug Fixes
 - Added All/Any option to match conditions in workflow
 - Fixed rule execution process for custom fields in Workflow and Listeners
 - Fixed Calendar plugin issues with templates
 - Fixed Knowledge base issues with visibility, article creation and catogry
 - Fixed auto close workflow status issue
 - Fixed issues for helptopic and type linking
 - UI issues


|====================================================
|   v1.9.22
|====================================================
This release is focused on optimizing the application to get better performance and load the pages faster on every browser. This release also provides bug fix patches for newly introduced features like Advance SLA enforcement, Workflow and Listeners.

## Enhancement and features
  * Visibility in labels allows you to choose who can view and add the labels on tickets
  * Helptopic and type linking module
  * Merge ticket from different users
  * Optimized JavaScript and CSS for faster page load time
  * Faveo external login allows  users to login to your app then migrate that session to Faveo so that the user does not have to login again in Faveo.

## Bugs fixes and Improvements
  * SLA enforcement was incorrect while adding labels/tags on tickets
  * Listeners actions were not working properly.
  * Workflow ordering was not working
  * Workflow with custom fields was not working
  * Various issues related to UI
  * Issues in LDAP plugin

|====================================================
|   v1.9.21
|====================================================
This release provides some hot-fix patches for v1.9.21.

## Bugs Fixed

  - Auto spell check issue with plugin fixed
  - Billing module functionality issue
  - Status tables implemented using Yajra and fixed delete status issue
  - UI Fixes

|====================================================
|   v1.9.20
|====================================================
Faveo v1.9.20 provides better SLA enforcement options and allows you to define more precise workflow for your HelpDesk system. It has various improvement patches and new functionalities to ensure that your customer's queries are reaching to correct department, with correct priority and SLA plans.

## Enhancement and features
  * ### SLA Enforcement options
    Define multiple enforcement rules for assigning correct SLA plan to tickets and calculate resolve time and resolution time.
  * ### Improved Workflow with more options
    Faveo had the option to define workflow for a ticket where you could define limited criteria to check Subject, email etc. in ticket and based on these criteria you could choose department or set priority or set helptopic of a ticket. This improvement in workflow reduces limitations on criteria(rules) to check and gives you option to define workflow actions based on various new criteria of ticket and user(requester of a ticket).

    PLEASE NOTE: This update may result delete your old workflow rules.

  * ### Listeners
    Using workflow you can check ticket/user fields for certain rules and then define helptopic ,department etc for a ticket which satisfies all defined rules. Workflow is executed only when a ticket is getting created in the system, but many a times you would like to perform different actions on basis of some action already performed on a ticket after creation.
    *Example:*
      > Set status of ticket as "Waiting for response" whenever any agent replies on a ticket
      OR
      > Change priority of a ticket when department is changed.

    Listeners are the set of event and action, which listens for defined events on tickets. Whenever any event takes place in on tickets listeners perform certain actions to update ticket. You can also define rules in listeners along with event and actions and make it more precise.
  * ### Auto spell check
    Editors in the system now has auto spell check functionality
  * ### Support for REDIS
    Now you can use REDIS as your queue to run scheduled jobs like sending outgoing mails etc.
  * ### Dashboard Statistics Settings
    Choose from various options to show tabs in Dashboard report table. You can also add custom fields in dashboard report table.
  * ### API updates
    Added new APIs for new functionalities. See our API documentation for more information

This release introduces various new features and enhancements in functionalities which were implemented for customization requests of different clients.
These release contains the update for requirements of `FinCare`, `PSV BANK`, `TILSOL`, `VIVANET` along with many feature enhancements and bug fixes in the system.

**Below is the list of all updates in detail**

* ### Custom forms for tickets are more advanced now
  - As in previous release we'd introduced new form for ticket creation which can be customized completely  for both agent and client panel. In addition to that we've added more default fields which can be used in ticket forms. You can change/add labels to show in both client and agent panel.
  - Now you can also pass parameters in ticket URL to render form with advance options like setting default value for fields in form, allowing clients to edit/fill value in form fields

If you want to give default value of subject in ticket from and your users not to be able provide subject of tickets you can add parameters like below exapmle
> http://faveo-system-url/create-ticket?subject=Pre%20filled%20ticket&subject_writable=1

This will render form like below
![form](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/31535872-4ad92ac6-b01a-11e7-9d31-e923f8f43b5b.PNG)
As you can see `subject` is already filled with the value we passed in parameter and not editable by user.

*  ### Create ticket independently on department or helptopic
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As tickets form can be customized according to requirement, you can remove or add department fields to be shown in ticket form for both client and agent panel.

* ### Google reCAPTCHA
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added google reCAPTCHA in forms to protect your FAVEO system from spam and abuse.

* ### More customized forms are available
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like ticket form we have added  two more forms which can be customized as required.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  - **User/requester** : Allows you to add all custom detail request which you want to get from your cleints like their age, nationality etc.
![user-requester](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/31536514-8a980e14-b01c-11e7-989b-47da4c6eec3d.PNG)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  - **Organization** : Allows you to add more custom fields to get more details about the organizations you add in Faveo system.
![orga](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/31536519-937af51e-b01c-11e7-8589-73a340c53736.PNG)

* ### Link multiple departments to helptopic
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now you can add multiple departments to helptopic and link them in ticket form. It will allow you to show certain departments linked to a particular helptopic in ticket forms.
![deptb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/31536640-fea719d0-b01c-11e7-913b-e15ccd0f4001.PNG)
![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/31536676-1adb23a8-b01d-11e7-8858-f5578c889cf7.gif)

* ### Automatically assigen ticket to agents based on location and type(skill)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  You can now add location and type(skills) to agent profiles. These will be used in auto assignment module. All the tickets will be assigned to agents location wise and type wise. For that `type` and `location` fields have been added in default fields of ticket form.

* ### Migrate your support system from `SPICEWORKS` to `FAVEO`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  If you are already using some system for your support/helpdesk and want to migrate to Faveo. Faveo has migration plugin to migrate your all data from your old system to Faveo. Migration plugin currently imports data from two systems which are listed below
    - **Os Ticket**
    - **SPICEWORKS**

* ### Ticket Forking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ticket forking allows you to create duplicate ticket if the tickets whose SLA has breached and still the issue has not been resolved. Forking a ticket will create a copy of ticket with fresh SLA.

* ### Recurring tickets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have a situation where same issue needs to be resolved repetitively then recurring tickets will make this easier for you. It can be helpful for scenarios like creating ticket for recurring bills etc.

* ### Updates in LDAP plugin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previous version of LDAP plugin used to allow users login via their LDAP credentials. We've updated LDAP plugin to import information from LDAP server and use in FAVEO system.

* ### Global access permission
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New permission module was introduced in the last version. Global Access Permission allows agents to see tickets of all departments without belonging to them.

* ### Reassigning tickets permission
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ticket has been assigned to one agent then assigning that ticket to another agent is called reassigning the ticket. Reassigning ticket permission allows you to define which agent can reassign tickets to other agents.

* ### Change due date of tickets
Now you can change due date of tickets manually and set it for new date.

* ### API updates
  - Consistency in API parameters
  - Change tickets status using API
  - Merge tickets using API
